Game	:	BOOST

About the game :
	I don't know the exact name of this game but we used to mention it as boost. It is an card game with four player included.

How to play : 
	At first each player will given with 3 randoms cards from the set of 12 cards (3*rose,3*lily,3*lotus,3*jasmine). Player 1 should give a card to the player 2. and player 2 needs to give a card to player 3 and now player 3 to player 4 and player 4 to player 1 and repeat the cycle. Each player should try to match all the 3 cards they have.

In my program use the number mention below each card to give it to the next player. the card with the character "-" indicates that it is an empty card. you can't exchange an empty card. please make sure that you exchange card an unwanted card. 


All The Best!!!
